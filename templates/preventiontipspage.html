    <div class="stage">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-circle icon"></i>Stage 0 - Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)</h3>
      <p>Stage 0 is the earliest stage of breast cancer where abnormal cells are confined to the milk ducts and haven't spread to nearby tissue.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular follow-up exams and screenings are crucial to monitor for any changes or progression.</li>
        <li>Consider surgical options like lumpectomy or mastectomy if recommended by your doctor.</li>
        <li>Discuss potential use of hormone therapy to prevent the development of invasive cancer.</li>
        <li>Continue to maintain a healthy diet, exercise, and avoid alcohol.</li>

    <!-- Stage I -->
    <div class="stage">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-circle icon"></i>Stage I - Early Invasive Breast Cancer</h3>
      <p>Stage I involves small tumors (less than 2 cm) that have begun to invade surrounding tissues but have not spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post-surgery care includes regular check-ups to ensure no recurrence.</li>
        <li>Consider adjuvant therapy (such as chemotherapy or radiation) to eliminate any remaining cancer cells.</li>
        <li>Engage in a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise to aid recovery and prevent recurrence.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Stage II -->
    <div class="stage">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-circle icon"></i>Stage II - Localized Breast Cancer</h3>
      <p>Stage II is characterized by tumors larger than 2 cm, which may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Undergo a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy as prescribed by your oncologist.</li>
        <li>Focus on managing side effects from treatments, such as fatigue, nausea, and pain.</li>

    <!-- Stage III -->
    <div class="stage">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-circle icon"></i>Stage III - Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</h3>
      <p>Stage III cancer involves larger tumors or cancer that has spread to several lymph nodes or the chest wall.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Combination of aggressive treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and possibly targeted therapy.</li>
        <li>Prepare for long-term management and regular follow-up appointments to monitor for recurrence.</li>

    </div>

    <!-- Stage IV -->
    <div class="stage">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-circle icon"></i>Stage IV - Metastatic Breast Cancer</h3>
      <p>Stage IV breast cancer means that the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ongoing treatment may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy to control cancer spread.</li>
        <li>Focus on quality of life, managing symptoms, and reducing the impact of treatments on daily activities.</li>
